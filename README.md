INSTALLATION
1. Copy all files from the Application to any folder on your computer (e.g. Documents\snip2clip)
2. Navigate to the folder and create a shortcut of 'snip2clip.jar'
	2.1 Right click and select properties and set a shortcut key (Only works some of the time for me??)
3. Move the shortcut you have created to "C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs"
4. Hit start and search shortcut name and hit enter.

HOW TO USE
1. Open application
2. Wait for overlay to appear on screen
3. Draw square by clicking and dragging over the text you want to copy
4. Wait a moment for the image to process (can take a couple seconds)
5. Paste copied text where ever you want

NOTES
- You can alt+tab out of the application 
- The overlay only appears on one screen at a time, to move to another screen move your mouse to that screen
- If the overlay is not on the same screen as your mouse and will not switch over, move mouse back over the overlay and mvoe back to other screen.
- This may not work for vertical monitor setups(untested)
- This may not work for horizontal monitor setups with monitor organisation different from mine(untested)
